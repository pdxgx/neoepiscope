Neoscan

Neoscan is a tool that takes a cancer patient's seq data (DNA and RNA from tumor and germline) and hollistically predits a set of the most likely neoantigens for possible personalized vaccine treatments.  We found that previous methods were limiting in their breadth, only accounting for a single SNV per epitope and disregarding indels and stop codon mutations entirely.  With this in mind, Neoscan emphasizes a combination of efficiency, coverage, and flexibility to provide the most accurate predictions of neoantigens.
